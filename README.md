# 🔐 Password Manager CLI

A simple and secure command-line password manager written in C++. It uses AES-256 encryption (via OpenSSL) to securely store login credentials for multiple websites, protected by a master password.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 AES-256-CBC file encryption using OpenSSL
- 🧪 PBKDF2 password hashing with salt and iteration (600,000 iterations)
- 💡 Simple interactive command-line interface
- 🧾 Site and account organization structure
- 🔑 Automatic strong password generator
- 📁 Encrypted storage in `.bin` file per user

## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++17 or later
- OpenSSL library (e.g., `libssl-dev`)
- `nlohmann/json` for JSON handling (included in `include/` folder)

## 🚀 Build & Run

### ✅ Dependencies

Install OpenSSL (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libssl-dev
```

### 🔧 Compile

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -lssl -lcrypto -o pam main.cpp
```

### ▶️ Run

```bash
./pam <username> <master_password>
```

## 🧭 Usage

Once launched, the application will guide you through:

- **[1] Show passwords** – Navigate and view stored credentials.
- **[2] Add password** – Add a new account under an existing or new site.
- **[3] Delete account** – Remove an account under a specific site.
- **[4] Delete site** – Remove an entire site and its associated accounts.
- **[0] Exit** – Exit and automatically save changes in an encrypted `.bin` file.

All data is encrypted and stored in a file named:

```
<username>.bin
```

## 🔐 Encryption Details

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 (HMAC-SHA256)
- **Iterations**: 600,000
- **Salt**: 8 bytes
- **IV**: 16 bytes
- **Key Size**: 32 bytes

## 🧪 Example

```bash
./pam alice my_secure_password
```

- If `alice.bin` exists: decrypt it using the password.
- If not: a new encrypted file will be created upon exit.

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- Do not share your `*.bin` file or master password.
- Passwords are only shown in plaintext on screen (not copied to clipboard).
